=== 1.2 Design Overview

This document exists to clarify design choices, provide neutral facts, and resolve confusion about IIS vs. Kestrel.

We acknowledge that kiosks are edge devices, not cloud-native by default, but the design applies cloud-native principles at the edge to set us up for hybrid/future integration.

==== 1.2.1 Legacy vs. Modern Models

- Why IIS central model is legacy
- Why embedded Kestrel is the default for .NET Core and aligns with other stacks (Spring Boot/Tomcat, Node/Express, Go, etc.)
- Thin client vs. fat client misconceptions
- Summary statement: embedded server â‰  fat client

==== 1.2.2 Core Design Artifacts

- Component diagram of the CUSS App (PlantUML/PNG)
- Internal components:
  * Embedded Kestrel
  * Workflow Engine
  * Workflow Builder (Admin Console)
  * Web Apps (Vue3, Workflow Runner)
  * Event Bus
  * Sidecar (CORBA / JSON adapter)
  * DI / Service Provider
  * Ports (HTTP/2, device APIs)
- File deployment model: workflows and apps installed as JSON + Vue3 web apps
