== 2. It's a CUSS App

This section addresses common misconceptions about CUSS applications and clarifies why they are designed to run locally with their own runtime components.

=== 2.1 CUSS Specification Guidance

The IATA CUSS specification includes addenda for **BYOB (Bring Your Own Browser)** and **BYOJ (Bring Your Own Java)**.

Both explicitly require local runtime components such as a browser engine or a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on the kiosk.

This proves the spec expects local artifacts, not a "remote-only" model.

=== 2.2 Standard Industry Practice

Airline apps routinely deploy JARs, DLLs, CORBA stubs, or device SDKs into their assigned CUSS home directory.

These files are essential for:
* **Talking to devices** - Direct hardware communication
* **Executing workflows** - Local business logic processing  
* **Handling degraded network conditions** - Offline resilience

=== 2.3 Risks of a Thin-Only Approach

==== 2.3.1 Specification Non-Compliance
Ignoring BYOB/BYOJ violates the assumptions of the standard.

==== 2.3.2 Resiliency Loss
A pure thin client fails completely when the network or central server is down.

==== 2.3.3 Device Access Gaps
Printers, scanners, scales, and payment devices require local libraries and plugins.

=== 2.4 Our Position

A CUSS application is **not just a remote client**. By design, it runs locally with its own runtime inside the assigned directory. 

This ensures:
* ✅ **Compliance** with IATA CUSS specifications
* ✅ **Resiliency** during network outages
* ✅ **Proper device integration** with local hardware
* ✅ **Thin-client spirit** for backend logic maintained

=== 2.5 High-Level Architecture

The CUSS application follows a **locally-hosted, edge-computing** architecture pattern:

. **Presentation Layer**: Touch-screen kiosk interface (WebView2)
. **Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic (Embedded Kestrel)
. **Integration Layer**: Airline system interfaces (HTTP/WebSocket)
. **Data Layer**: Local caching and logging (SQLite/JSON)
. **Device Layer**: Hardware abstraction (CUSS DCI/Sidecar)

=== 2.6 Component Overview

==== 2.6.1 Local Runtime Components

* **Embedded Kestrel Server**: Self-hosted web server (.NET Core)
* **WebView2 Browser Engine**: Modern HTML5/CSS3/JS execution environment
* **Workflow Engine**: Local workflow execution and state management
* **Device Adapters**: CORBA/JSON bridges for CUSS device communication

==== 2.6.2 Integration Services

* **Authentication service**: Secure passenger verification
* **Booking retrieval service**: Real-time flight and passenger data
* **Payment processing service**: Secure transaction handling
* **Printing service**: Boarding pass and baggage tag output

==== 2.6.3 Resilience Features

* **Offline capability**: Continue operation during network outages
* **Local caching**: Store essential data for degraded scenarios
* **Graceful degradation**: Reduced functionality when services unavailable
* **Automatic recovery**: Reconnect and sync when connectivity restored
