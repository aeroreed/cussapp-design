# Sections Directory

This directory contains modular AsciiDoc files for each major section of the CUSS App Design Documentation.

## File Organization

Each major section is separated into its own file for better maintainability:

- `01-introduction.adoc` - Introduction and project scope
- `02-system-architecture.adoc` - System architecture and components
- `03-user-interface-design.adoc` - UI design principles and screen flows
- `04-security-requirements.adoc` - Security and data protection requirements
- `05-integration-specifications.adoc` - Integration with airline and airport systems
- `06-technical-specifications.adoc` - Hardware and software requirements
- `07-implementation-guidelines.adoc` - Deployment and maintenance guidelines
- `08-deployment-update-strategy.adoc` - .NET Core deployment strategy
- `09-compliance-standards.adoc` - Industry standards and regulatory compliance
- `10-appendices.adoc` - Glossary and references

## Benefits of Modular Structure

✅ **Better Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different sections simultaneously
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one section don't affect others
✅ **Improved Version Control**: Git diffs are cleaner and more focused
✅ **Reusability**: Sections can be included in other documents
✅ **Faster Editing**: Smaller files load and edit faster
✅ **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns

## Usage

All sections are automatically included in the main `index.adoc` file using AsciiDoc's `include::` directive:

```asciidoc
include::sections/01-introduction.adoc[]
include::sections/02-system-architecture.adoc[]
// ... etc
```

## Adding New Sections

To add a new section:

1. Create a new `.adoc` file with appropriate naming (e.g., `11-new-section.adoc`)
2. Add the content using level 2 headings (`==`) for the main section
3. Use level 3 (`===`) and level 4 (`====`) headings for subsections
4. Add the include statement to `index.adoc`
5. Rebuild the documentation

## Subsection Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the content
- Start each file with a level 2 heading (`==`)
- Use consistent numbering scheme
- Include relevant diagrams and images using relative paths
- Keep related content together in the same file

## Building

The build script automatically copies this directory to `docs/sections/` so the includes work properly in the generated HTML.
