=== Key Advantages of .NET Core Deployment Model

Unlike the legacy IIS-centric model, .NET Core apps are *not bound to a single central deployment point*.

* Each kiosk runs a self-contained runtime
* Updates can be *pushed or pulled* using whichever enterprise method the airport IT prefers
* This flexibility allows updates to either the *CUSS App runtime* itself or to the *workflows* (e.g., bag check, check-in) without distinction
* We can develop *any provisioning or update model we want* using the tools already in place â€” there is no mystery here
* Updates fit naturally into *any CI/CD toolchain we already use or adopt*, or into *any kind of update console we desire*
* This can be designed from scratch or implemented with *off-the-shelf tools* like PowerShell, WiX, SCCM, or Intune

In short: *any model of updates you want is supported.*
