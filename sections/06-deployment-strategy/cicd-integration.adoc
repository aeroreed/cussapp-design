=== 6.3 CI/CD Integration

==== 6.3.1 Build Pipeline Integration

===== Continuous Integration
* Automated builds triggered by source code changes
* Multi-stage build pipelines with quality gates
* Parallel builds for different deployment targets
* Integration with version control systems (Git, Azure DevOps)

===== Build Automation
* MSBuild and dotnet CLI integration
* Automated testing and code quality checks
* Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
* Performance testing and benchmarking

# Azure DevOps Pipeline Example
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - release/*

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildApp
    steps:
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'Restore packages'
      inputs:
        command: 'restore'

===== Artifact Management
* Versioned artifact storage and retrieval
* Binary repository integration (Azure Artifacts, Artifactory)
* Metadata tracking for deployments
* Retention policies for artifact cleanup

==== 6.3.2 Deployment Automation

===== Infrastructure as Code
* ARM templates for Azure resource provisioning
* Terraform modules for multi-cloud deployments
* PowerShell DSC for configuration management
* Ansible playbooks for Linux environments (if applicable)

===== Release Management
* Multi-environment promotion pipelines
* Approval workflows for production deployments
* Automated rollback triggers and procedures
* Deployment scheduling and maintenance windows
