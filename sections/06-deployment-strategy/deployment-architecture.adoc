=== 6.1 Deployment Architecture

==== 6.1.1 .NET Core Self-Contained Model

===== Runtime Distribution
* Each kiosk runs a self-contained .NET Core runtime
* No dependency on centralized IIS or web server infrastructure
* Eliminates "DLL hell" and Global Assembly Cache (GAC) conflicts
* Consistent runtime environment across all deployment targets

===== Application Packaging
* Self-contained deployments include all required dependencies
* Portable executable (PE) format for Windows kiosks
* Version-specific deployment folders prevent conflicts
* Digital signing for integrity and authenticity verification

===== Infrastructure Requirements
* Minimal server infrastructure requirements
* Local file system storage for application binaries
* Network connectivity for update distribution
* Standard Windows service hosting capabilities

==== 6.1.2 Deployment Flexibility

===== Multi-Modal Distribution
* Support for push-based enterprise distribution (SCCM, Intune)
* Pull-based auto-update mechanisms
* Manual deployment via file shares and scripts
* Hybrid approaches combining multiple distribution methods

===== Targeted Deployment Strategies
* Granular deployment targeting (single kiosk, airline, terminal)
* Staggered rollout capabilities for risk mitigation
* Blue-green deployment support for zero-downtime updates
* Rollback mechanisms for rapid recovery from failed deployments

===== Environment Isolation
* Development, staging, and production environment separation
* Environment-specific configuration management
* Isolated testing environments for validation
* Quality gates between deployment stages

==== 6.1.3 Scalability and Performance

===== Horizontal Scaling
* Stateless application design for easy scaling
* Load balancing across multiple kiosk instances
* Auto-scaling based on passenger volume and demand
* Resource optimization for kiosk hardware constraints

===== Performance Optimization
* Application startup time optimization
* Memory footprint minimization for kiosk environments
* Network bandwidth optimization for updates
* Caching strategies for improved responsiveness
