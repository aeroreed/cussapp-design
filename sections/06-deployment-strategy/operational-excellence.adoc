    private readonly ILogger<DeploymentService> _logger;
    
    public async Task<DeploymentResult> DeployAsync(string version, string target)
    {
        using var scope = _logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["Version"] = version,

            ["OperationId"] = Guid.NewGuid()
        });
        
        _logger.LogInformation("Starting deployment of version {Version} to {Target}", version, target);
        
        try
        {
            var result = await PerformDeploymentAsync(version, target);
