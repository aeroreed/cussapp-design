=== 5.2 Workflow Builder (Admin Console)

The Workflow Builder provides a user interface for creating and managing workflow definitions.

==== 5.2.1 Design Interface

The Workflow Builder features a **visual, drag-and-drop interface** for creating workflows without coding.

==== 5.2.2 WorkFlow Builder Wireframes

===== View / Page Editor (WYSIWYG)

[cols="3,7"]
|===
| Toolbox (UI Components) | Canvas (Workflow View) | Properties Panel

| [Input Field]  
  [Button]  
  [Label]  
  [Image]  
  [Dropdown]  

| +----------------------------------+  
| | [Label: Passenger Lookup]        |  
| | [Input: Last Name]               |  
| | [Button: Search]                 |  
| +----------------------------------+  

| Component: Button  
  Label: "Search"  
  ID: searchBtn  
  DSL Binding: LookupPassenger.execute  
|===

[NOTE]  
====
What's happening here:  
- Left panel = available UI elements to drag.  
- Middle = WYSIWYG editor of the workflow view.  
- Right = edit attributes, styles, and DSL bindings for selected component.

===== DSL Binding Panel

[cols="2,8"]
|===
| Component Selected | Binding Options

| Button: "Print Bag Tag"  
  ID: printBtn  

| DSL Command: BagTag.print  
  Event: onClick  
  Params: { "printer":"bagtag01" }  
|===

[NOTE]  
====
What's happening here:  
- When a component is selected, you can bind DSL commands (see section 5.3).  
- Events (onClick, onSubmit, onLoad) trigger DSL execution.  
- Supports parameterized calls with dynamic substitution.
