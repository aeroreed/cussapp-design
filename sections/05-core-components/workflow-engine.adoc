=== 5.1 Workflow Engine

The Workflow Engine is the core component that executes workflow definitions and manages state transitions.

==== 5.1.1 Execution Model

The Workflow Engine operates on a **state machine model** where:

* **Workflows** are defined as a sequence of steps/views
* **State transitions** are triggered by user actions or system events
* **Business logic** is executed through DSL commands
* **Context data** flows between steps

==== 5.1.2 Core Responsibilities

* **Workflow Loading**: Parse and validate workflow definitions from JSON
* **State Management**: Track current step, user progress, and session data
* **Event Processing**: Handle user interactions and system events
* **DSL Execution**: Execute business logic commands and handle responses
* **Error Handling**: Manage exceptions and provide recovery mechanisms
* **Device Integration**: Coordinate with CUSS platform for device operations

==== 5.1.4 State Management

The engine maintains workflow state including:

* **Current Step**: Active step in the workflow
* **User Context**: Passenger data, selections, form inputs
* **Session Data**: Temporary data valid for current session
* **Configuration**: Airline-specific settings and branding
* **Device Status**: Availability of printers, scanners, etc.

==== 5.1.5 Event Handling
