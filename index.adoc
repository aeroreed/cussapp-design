== Overview

This document outlines the design and architecture for the CUSS (Common Use Self Service) application.

== 1. Introduction

The CUSS application is designed to provide a standardized interface for airline passengers to check in, print boarding passes, and manage their travel experience at airport kiosks.

6. Baggage declaration
7. Boarding pass printing
8. Receipt and summary

== 4. Security Requirements

=== 4.1 Data Protection

* All passenger data encrypted in transit and at rest
* PCI DSS compliance for payment processing

=== 4.2 Authentication

* Multi-factor authentication options
* Biometric verification (where available)
* Time-based session management
* Audit logging for all transactions

== 5. Integration Specifications

=== 5.1 Airline Systems

The CUSS application integrates with:

* **DCS (Departure Control System)**: For flight and passenger data
* **PSS (Passenger Service System)**: For booking modifications
* **Payment Gateway**: For processing fees and upgrades
* **Baggage Handling System**: For baggage tag printing

=== 5.2 Airport Systems

* **FIDS (Flight Information Display System)**: For real-time flight updates
* **Security Systems**: For passenger screening integration
* **Ground Handling**: For special service requests

== 6. Technical Specifications

=== 6.1 Hardware Requirements

* **Processor**: Minimum Intel i5 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum
* **Storage**: 256GB SSD
* **Display**: 22" touch screen, minimum 1920x1080
* **Connectivity**: Ethernet and WiFi capability

=== 6.2 Software Requirements

* **Operating System**: Windows 10 IoT Enterprise or Linux
* **Browser Engine**: Chromium-based for web components
* **Print Drivers**: Support for thermal and laser printers
* **Security Software**: Endpoint protection and monitoring

== 7. Implementation Guidelines

=== 7.1 Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Testing**
   * Unit testing of all components
   * Integration testing with airline systems
   * User acceptance testing
   * Security penetration testing

2. **Staging Environment**
   * Mirror production environment
   * Full end-to-end testing
   * Performance testing under load
   * Disaster recovery testing

3. **Production Deployment**
   * Phased rollout approach
   * Real-time monitoring
   * Immediate rollback capability
   * 24/7 support availability

=== 7.2 Maintenance and Support

* **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring
* **Updates**: Automated security updates, scheduled feature updates
* **Support**: Tiered support structure (L1, L2, L3)
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive operational guides

== 8. Deployment and Update Strategy (.NET Core Model)

=== 8.1 Wide-Open Update Palette

Unlike the legacy IIS-centric model, .NET Core apps are *not bound to a single central deployment point*.

* Each kiosk runs a self-contained runtime
* Updates can be *pushed or pulled* using whichever enterprise method the airport IT prefers
* This flexibility allows updates to either the *CUSS App runtime* itself or to the *workflows* (e.g., bag check, check-in) without distinction
* We can develop *any provisioning or update model we want* using the tools already in place — there is no mystery here
* Updates fit naturally into *any CI/CD toolchain we already use or adopt*, or into *any kind of update console we desire*
* This can be designed from scratch or implemented with *off-the-shelf tools* like PowerShell, WiX, SCCM, or Intune

In short: *any model of updates you want is supported.*

=== 8.2 Supported Update Methods

==== 8.2.1 Enterprise Distribution (SCCM, Intune, etc.)
* Package the .NET Core app as MSI or EXE
* Push to all kiosks or target a subset
* Supports staggered rollout (one terminal, one airline, or one group at a time)

==== 8.2.2 File Share + PowerShell
* Store the latest version in a secured share
* PowerShell script (or Scheduled Task) copies binaries to kiosks

==== 8.2.3 Auto-Update Agent
* Lightweight background process on each kiosk
* Compares local `version.json` with central manifest
* Downloads and applies updates automatically

==== 8.2.4 ClickOnce (Optional)
* Provides pull-based, self-updating deployment
* Kiosks fetch updates at login or restart

=== 8.3 Benefits Over Legacy IIS Model

* *No bottleneck*: Updates aren't limited to what's hosted centrally on IIS
* *Targeted rollouts*: Update one kiosk, one airline, or one workflow segment at a time
* *Resilience*: If a kiosk is offline during rollout, it updates next time it checks in
* *Consistency*: Self-contained .NET Core deployments avoid "DLL hell" and GAC conflicts
* *Flexibility*: Our admin console can orchestrate updates as efficiently and cleanly as any legacy central IIS model
* *Modernization*: Fits into today's CI/CD pipelines and leverages proven enterprise tools without reinventing the wheel

=== 8.4 Key Rebuttals to Concerns

* *Claim:* "You can't update kiosks if you don't use IIS." +
  *Answer:* In .NET Core, kiosks are updated the same as any Windows app: via MSI, EXE, script, or agent. IT already has these tools.

* *Claim:* "Thin clients can't have a local runtime." +
  *Answer:* All kiosk apps today (Java, BYOB) already install local artifacts (JRE, browser, DLLs). A .NET Core runtime is no different.

* *Claim:* "Central IIS is required for consistency." +
  *Answer:* Consistency is handled by packaging/versioning. Central IIS is actually a single point of failure — distributed apps are more resilient.

=== 8.5 Deployment Workflow Example

1. `dotnet publish` creates versioned build artifacts
2. Build pipeline signs and packages into MSI
3. Package staged on secure share
4. IT pushes or kiosks pull updates
5. Kiosk restarts app and runs the new version

=== 8.6 Summary

* .NET Core gives us a *wide-open palette* of update strategies
* Updates are as simple as publishing new artifacts and distributing them with standard IT tools
* Our admin console can *provision and update* as effectively as any legacy IIS model, but with more flexibility and resilience
* These updates fit into *any CI/CD toolchain* or *update console* — whether custom-designed or based on off-the-shelf tools like PowerShell and SCCM
* The result is a *better, cleaner, and more future-proof* system for updating both the CUSS App runtime and the web application workflows

== 9. Compliance and Standards

* **IATA CUSS Standard**: Full compliance with IATA specifications
